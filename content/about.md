Iâ€™m Kumaran Gowrisankar, though many know me by my nickname, Gokul.

I have a keen interest in learning about distributed computing technologies. I'm a graduate student at Texas A&M University, pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science. I previously worked as a software engineer at [slice](https://www.sliceit.com/), building payment systems. Before that, I graduated from [NIT-Trichy](https://nitt.edu/). 

Check out my [ resume ](/blog/resume) for a detailed look at my professional experience and skills.

## Interests

I enjoy outdoor activities. I'm always on the hunt for amazing trails to hike. Let me know if you want a hiking partner. Recently,  I've taken up running. I also enjoy hitting the gym regularly.
I enjoy watching FC Barcelona win. Lately, they've not been winning much.
